                    A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL</h2>
                <p style="color: #666666;font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.8;margin: 0 0 15px;text-align: center;">The
                    Bardsley English Medium Senior Secondary school was started in the year 1964, with classes from
                    K. G.1 to class IV. These classes were held on the verandah. Gradually under the able and dedicated
                    leadership of Mrs. Rachael Cooke the founder of this institution, the beautiful building, consisting
                    of a big hall, the staff room, 8 classrooms and a laboratory came up and the classes were upgraded
                    up to class VIII. This building was dedicated to Mrs. Rachael Cooke and a tablet with the
                    inscription ‘Great are thy Blessings, O’ Lord’ was unveiled by her on the 23rd January, 1976. The
                    school, which now consisted of classes from K. G. 1 to class VIII was the much wanted first English
                    Medium School of the town for which people of Katni always remember Mrs. R. Cooke with deep regard.

                            After the sad demise of Mrs. R. Cooke due to a brief illness on the 11th January 1986, Miss.
                            C. P. Salve took over as an in-charge and looked after the school from February 1986 to
                            December 1987, alongside with her responsibility as the Principal of the Bardsley Girl’s
                            Higher Secondary School. On the 1st January 1988 Rev. S. Nelson took over the charge as
                            Principal from Miss C. P. Salve. Under the able leadership and untiring efforts of Former
                            Principal Rev.S. Nelson the school has increased its stature by leaps and bounds.

                        class="mt-4"> In the year 1989 the school was upgraded as high school. Again in the year 1991-92
                        it was
                        upgraded as Higher Secondary School having Science and Commerce streams. The School is now
                        managed by the BECNIJD (Board of Education Church of North India Jabalpur Diocese) with the
                        Bishop as the chairman. Previously BECNIJD was known as NDBE (Nagpur Diocesan Board of
                        Education). <br><br>

                        The school is now a full-fledged Senior Secondary School, affiliated to the CBSE (Central Board
                        of Secondary Education) New Delhi from 01/04/1998. This could only be possible due to the keen
                        interest and encouragement of the management headed by our former chairmen, The Rt. Rev. F. C.
                        Jonathan, The Rt. Rev. S. Cak and our Present Bishop and Chairman, The Most Rev. Dr. P.C. Singh,
                        our hardworking and dynamic Manager of the school Mrs. Norah Singh and continuous efforts of our
                        Principal Rev. S. Nelson. <br><br>

                        Four new Blocks, Block-‘A’, Block-‘B’, Block-‘C’ and Block-‘D’ have been added till date. Our
                        Hon’ble Moderator, CNI Synod, Bishop of Jabalpur Diocese and Chairman, The Most Rev. Dr. P. C.
                        Singh inaugurated the ‘D’-Block. We have recently added 6 new rooms in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ Blocks
                        and a new staircase has been added between ‘B’ and ‘C’ Blocks. We have projects for 6 more
                        classrooms and one Auditorium. The school has a good library, book bank, well ventilated
                        classrooms, playgrounds, gardens, and advanced laboratories for all faculties. <br><br>


                        Our students have brought rich laurels to the school with their good performance in their
                        studies, debates, games and other activities. Due to the efforts of our Hon’ble Moderator CNI,
                        Synod and Bishop of Jabalpur Diocese The Most Rev. Dr. P. C. Singh, we also have the Indian
                        Overseas Bank (IOB) in our school premises where the School Fee is accepted encouraging the
                        slogan "Cashless India" by our Honourable Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi . Today we can
                        reiterate with conviction our inscription, ‘Great are thy Blessings O’ Lord’. <br><br>

                        The school is a Minority run Institution which takes NO GRANT FROM THE GOVERNMENT and depends
                        entirely on the money obtained as fee from the pupils. Now the school is being headed by the
                        Officiating Principal Mr. Atul Anupam Abraham. <br><br>

                        Our motto “Love and Serve” handed down to us by our founder, inspires us to love and serve our
                        fellow beings. May the almighty God guide us and bless us in this great endeavour of service to
                        humanity no looking back, but ever striving to bring out the best in our students to make them
                        worthy citizens of the nation. Amen.</p>
